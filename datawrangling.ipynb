For example, \"Ave\" and \"Avenue\" were both used, when, ideally, the same notation would be used to describe the same type of street. In order to correct this, I used the following function to convert both common stand-ins (such as \"St\" and \"St.\" for \"Streets\") and more specific ones to this dataset (such as correcting \"Boulvevard\" to \"Boulevard\"):\n",

However, the dataset itself is very clearly incomplete, as evidenced by the very last exploratory look where only 6 of 50 Subway locations are tagged as cafes. Improved and consistent tagging of locations such as these would allow for more accurate exploration of the data; however, implementing this on a programmatic basis would be difficult as individual exceptions would likely have to be programmed for each case such as creating a corresponding \"cafe\" tag for all Subway locations (or, alternatively, removing the tag). While that would be simple enouogh for Subway, individual chains (cafe, fast food, restaurant, bank, or otherwise) would need their own self-consistency checks."
