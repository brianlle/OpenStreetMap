# OpenStreetMap
Investigation of San Jose, CA area using OpenStreetMap data.

In this project, I investigated the OpenStreetMap XML data of San Jose, CA. To do so, I imported the data to a SQL database. The data had some inconsistencies among how information was stored. My data wrangling process included updating street addresses for consistency (e.g. converting "Avenue" to "Ave") and truncating zip codes to their 5-digit code. The data wrangling process and the investigation are described in datawrangling.html
